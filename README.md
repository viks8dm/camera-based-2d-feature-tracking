# 2D Feature Tracking (Camera Based)

<img src="images/keypoints.png" width="820" height="248" />

The idea behind this work is to setup appropriate framework for a camera-lidar based collision detection/avoidance system. For this purpose, a camera-based 2D feature tracker is built here and various detector / descriptor combinations are tested, to see which ones perform best. There are four-parts to the project:

* loading images, setting up data structures and putting everything into a ring buffer to optimize memory load.
* integrate several keypoint detectors such as HARRIS, FAST, BRISK and SIFT and compare them with regard to number of keypoints and speed.
* then focus on descriptor extraction and matching using brute force and also the FLANN approach.
* once the code framework is complete, test various algorithms in different combinations and compare them with regard to some performance measures.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 2.8
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./2D_feature_tracking`.

## Results

After implementation of keypoint-detection, descriptor extraction and keypoint-matching in consecutive images, the results obtained are presented in the following sections. Here are some notes on the results:

* AKAZE detector works only with AKAZE descriptor
* For matching with SIFT descriptor we need to use FLANN. SIFT does not work with BF
* SIFT detector and ORB descriptor do not work together
* for SHITOMASI blockSize of 4 has been used
* for HARRIS blockSize of 2 has been used

#### Keypoint-detected

Total number of keypoints detected by each method for every image are listed in the table bellow:

Corresponding time taken in detection is shown in the plot here along with a sample output for `AKAZE` descriptor:

Associated number of keypoints detected on preceding vehicle in the images are:

#### Neighborhood size

As far as distribution of neighborhood size of keypoints detected on preceding vehicle is concerned, some of the detector methods have fixed neighborhood sizes, namely:

* SHITOMASI -- 4
* HARRIS -- 6
* FAST -- 7

while others have a distribution, among which ORB seems to have large spread. The distribution is shown in following four figures and standard deviation is tabulated here:

| detector | BRISK | ORB | AKAZE | SIFT |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| standard-deviation| 14.40 | 25.83 | 3.43 | 6.30 |

These results and all others presented above are derived from data that can be found in the [results excel-sheet](./results/results.xlsx)


## Recommendation

In a dynamic scenario like autonomous driving, the speed and accuracy of detection are of utmost importance. Hence, to arrive at recommendation, I computed the ratio of mean-matched-keypoints to mean-detection-extraction-time, defining a score parameter as:

```
score = 1000 * (mean-matched-keypoints / mean-detection-extraction-time)
```

The corresponding scores are shown in image below, with highest three highlighted in different shades of green.

<img src="results/ratio_points_time.jpg" width="750" height="270" />


Based on these scores my recommendations are:


| rank | detector | descriptor |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| 1 | FAST | ORB |
| 2 | FAST | BRIEF |
| 3 | SHITOMASI | BRIEF |
